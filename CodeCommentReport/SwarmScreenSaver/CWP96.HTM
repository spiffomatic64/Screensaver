<DIV CLASS="Description">

Constructor creates a manualEvent for each screen and one more for shutting down.
then it initializes the event to untriggered. The delegates below signal the event
as happened, so that the main thread's while loop continues when an event happens.
Additionally, I have utilized ManualEvents to cause my while loop to stop looping
and wait for an event to be fired instead of looping uselessly, the wait stops the
thread until an event fires to respond to. This dramatically lessens the load on the
CPU, that was wasted in looping over and over while waiting for an event. This was 
causing the InvalidOperationEvent error that was taking place because it was tying up
the OS looping all the time. I could not put in an Application.DoEvent() call because
it was interrupting the drawing and causing bad flicker. Instead, now that the main 
thread goes to sleep, I have accomplished the same thing, by freeing up the load the 
screensaver was putting on the computer cpu just looping.
